# Introduction

Welcome to Rev! We hope you enjoy this module as much as we do, here at Grid.

Rev comes from the two words Roblox, and Evidence as what this module does is gives you methods to figure out what your user's Roblox accounts _really_ are.

This is our Getting Started Documentation, to get you started down the right track for Rev.

## Disclaimer

Rev is still an in-development library, so expect bugs to appear, and methods to change. We will give a heads-up in advance, but there will almost undoubtedly be breaking changes in the future.

Please do not take this as a discouragement, as we believe that it is ready for use, but please remember to keep up with the docs and the GitHub page.
