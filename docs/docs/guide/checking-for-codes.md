# Checking for Codes

## Basic Usage

Now, we are ready to check for codes on Roblox user's profiles. To start, grab a sentance, word or your entire description from your Roblox account, and place it in a variable. You

```javascript title="index.js"
const myDescription = "Sample Description";
```

Then you can use the method `checkForCode` to check if the code is somewhere on your profile.

```javascript title="index.js"
const myDescription = "Sample Description";
const myUserId = 333179113;

console.log(await rev.checkForCode(myUserId, myDescription));
```

The User ID comes first, then the code. If possible, use async/await as it allows the code to be executed asynchronously rather than synchronously. If you run this piece of code, you should now see an output exactly like this:

```bash title="Console"
true
```

Now if you change the variable `myDescription` to something that is not on your profile, it should now return false.

```bash title="Console"
false
```

## Proxies

A feature that is supported on the function, is that you can pass in a proxy as the third argument. The reason as to why you might want to use a proxy differs, but most of the time it is due to CORS or self-hosting for logging purposes.

There are many proxies out there, but here is a list of the top few:

- [ProxyService](https://github.com/sentanos/ProxyService) (self-hosted)
- [rprxy](https://github.com/sentanos/rprxy) (self-hosted)
- [RoProxy](https://roproxy.com)

You can use whichever you please, but for this example we will be using RoProxy, because of us not having to host it ourselves.

_pssst! docs are in progress, but you can help finish them_
