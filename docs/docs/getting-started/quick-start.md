# Quick Start

Once you have Rev installed, you're ready to start using it!

```javascript title="index.js"
// CommonJS
const rev = require("@grid-rbx/rev");

// ES6 (recommended)
import rev from "@grid-rbx/rev;

// Browser
import rev from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/@grid-rbx/rev';
```

Rev can be imported using either, but due to it being more modern, we recommend that you use the Es6 `import` method. Of course, there is also the browser method, which we recommend you use if you are using vanilla JS.
